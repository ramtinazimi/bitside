1. Instructions.
The instructions for the coding challenge can be read here: https://gist.github.com/kaelumania/adab300b8e486ed79eae83b5792776ef

2. Architecture for solving the problem.

2.1. Classes.
We have created two classes for objects: **Basket** and **Product**.
- Every product has an id and a price.
- Every basket has a list of products which are contained in the basket.

2.2. Products on Sale.
There are two types of sales: A "Buy-1-Get-1-Free"-sale and a "10%-Percentage"-sale.
For each type of sale, there is a list in the **Main**-class.
The user can add products to either of these two lists and 
the basket will automatically calculate the total taking into account the products on sales.
